# Contribute

## Overview
Anyone is welcome to contribute to O3DE. You can contribute code, documentation or even to the process itself.

Please ensure you've read the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct.md), [values](/values.md) and general [contribution guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

## Getting started
If you do not know where to start in the project but want to contribute, find the [SIG](/sigs) that works in the areas you are interested in. Introduce yourself on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/o3de), or at a [SIG meeting](https://lists.o3de.org/g/o3de-calendar/calendar). 

You can also look for the [`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agood-first-issue) label in GitHub.

## Develop
Learn how to develop on GitHub and the specifics of developing for O3DE in the [GitHub Workflows](https://www.o3de.org/docs/contributing/to-code/git-workflow/) guide.

If submitting code, ensure you've read our coding guidance, which include:
* [C++ Coding Standards](https://github.com/o3de/sig-core/blob/main/governance/Coding-Standards-and-Style-Guide.md)
* [C++ Best Practices](https://github.com/o3de/sig-core/blob/main/governance/C%2B%2B-Best-Practices-Guide.md)
* [API reference guidance](https://github.com/o3de/sig-core/blob/main/governance/API-Ref-Guidelines-Update.md) for writing self-documenting code.

Understand how [code reviews](/guides/o3de-code-review-guidelines.md) work, along with how to provide construct feedback.

Finally, read the guidance around [code deprecation](/guides/o3de-deprecation-guidelines.md) to ensure your changes do impact others. 
This guide should be used when replacing functionality, renaming public APIs and other potentially breaking changes.
