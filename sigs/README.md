# O3DE Special Interest Groups
O3DE is a very large project. Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are the way we divide up the planning and communication for the different areas and responsibilities around developing and maintaining O3DE. 

## SIGs
Currently, O3DE has the following active SIGs:

|     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|
| [SIG-Build](https://github.com/o3de/sig-build) | [SIG-Content](https://github.com/o3de/sig-content) | [SIG-Core](https://github.com/o3de/sig-core) |
| [SIG-Docs](https://github.com/o3de/sig-docs-community) | [SIG-Network](https://github.com/o3de/sig-network) | [Sig-Operations](https://github.com/o3de/sig-operations) |
| [SIG-Platform](https://github.com/o3de/sig-platform) | [SIG-Graphics-Audio](https://github.com/o3de/sig-graphics-audio) | [SIG-Release](https://github.com/o3de/sig-release) | 
| [SIG-Security](https://github.com/o3de/sig-security) | [SIG-Simulation](https://github.com/o3de/sig-simulation) | [SIG-Testing](https://github.com/o3de/sig-testing) |
| [SIG-UI-UX](https://github.com/o3de/sig-ui-ux) || | 

### Find out what a SIG owns

To identify what a SIG owns, you can:
* Use the [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
* Use the [Code Owners file](https://github.com/o3de/o3de/blob/development/.github/CODEOWNERS) which shows the reviewer or maintainer groups that owns a particular area of O3DE.
* Or use the links above to look at the SIGs own documentation; all SIGs have a charter document that covers what they own directly, what they own in conjunction with other SIGs etc.

### How do I get involved?
SIGs are open to all. You can join the discussion on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/o3de)
or attend any of the public meetings. Use the [O3DE Calendar](https://lists.o3de.org/g/o3de-calendar/calendar) to find upcoming SIG meetings.
